       "[60] The next week , Rice was briefed on the activities of Abu Zubaydah and on CIA efforts\n",
       "[61] to locate him .\n",
       "[62] As pointed out in chapter 6 , Abu Zubaydah had been a major figure in\n",
       "[63] the millennium plots .\n",
       "[64] Over the next few weeks , the CIA repeatedly issued\n",
       "[65] warnings-including calls from DCI Tenet to Clarke -that Abu Zubaydah was planning an\n",
       "[66] operation in the near future .\n",
       "[67] One report cited a source indicating that Abu Zubaydah\n",
       "[68] was planning an attack in a country that CIA analysts thought might be Israel , or\n",
       "[69] perhaps Saudi Arabia or India .\n",
       "[70] Clarke relayed these reports to Rice .\n",
       "[71] In response to these threats , the FBI sent a message to all its field offices on\n",
       "[72] April 13 , summarizing reporting to date .\n",
       "[73] It asked the offices to task all resources,\n",
       "[74] including human sources and electronic databases , for any information pertaining to\n",
       "[75] '' current operational activities relating to Sunni extremism . ''\n",
       "[76] It did not suggest\n",
       "[77] that there was a domestic threat .\n",
       "[78] The interagency Counterterrorism Security Group ( CSG ) that Clarke chaired discussed\n",
       "[79] the Abu Zubaydah reports on April 19 .\n",
       "[80] The next day , a briefing to top officials\n",
       "[81] reported `` Bin Ladin planning multiple operations . ''\n",
       "[82] When the deputies discussed al\n",
       "[83] Qaeda policy on April 30 , they began with a briefing on the threat .\n",
       "[84] In May 2001 , the drumbeat of reporting grew louder with reports to top officials that\n",
       "[85] '' Bin Ladin public profile may presage attack '' and `` Bin Ladin network 's plans\n",
       "[86] advancing . ''\n",
       "[87] In early May , a walk-in to the FBI claimed there was a plan to launch\n",
       "[88] attacks on London , Boston , and New York .\n",
       "[89] Attorney General John Ashcroft was briefed\n",
       "[90] by the CIA on May 15 regarding al Qaeda generally and the current threat reporting\n",
       "[91] specifically .\n",
       "[92] The next day brought a report that a phone call to a U.S. embassy had\n",
       "[93] warned that Bin Ladin supporters were planning an attack in the United States using\n",
       "[94] '' high explosives . ''\n",
       "[95] On May 17 , based on the previous day 's report , the first item on\n",
       "[96] the CSG 's agenda was `` UBL : Operation Planned in U.S. ''\n",
       "[97] The\n",
       "[98] anonymous caller 's tip could not be corroborated .\n",
       "[99] Late May brought reports of a possible hostage plot against Americans abroad to force\n",
       "[100] the release of prisoners , including Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman , the `` Blind Sheikh , ''\n",
       "[101] who was serving a life sentence for his role in the 1993 plot to blow up sites in\n",
       "[102] New York City .\n",
       "[103] The reporting noted that operatives might opt to hijack an aircraft\n",
       "[104] or storm a U.S. embassy .\n",
       "[105] This report led to a Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA )\n",
       "[106] information circular to airlines noting the potential for `` an airline hijacking to\n",
       "[107] free terrorists incarcerated in the United States . ''\n",
       "[108] Other reporting mentioned that\n",
       "[109] Abu Zubaydah was planning an attack , possibly against Israel , and expected to carry\n",
       "[110] out several more if things went well .\n",
       "[111] On May 24 alone , counterterrorism officials\n",
       "[112] grappled with reports alleging plots in Yemen and Italy , as well as a report about a\n",
       "[113] cell in Canada that an anonymous caller had claimed might be planning an attack\n",
       "[114] against the United States .\n",
       "[115] Reports similar to many of these were made available to President Bush in morning\n",
       "[116] intelligence briefings with DCI Tenet , usually attended by Vice President Dick\n",
       "[117] Cheney and National Security Advisor Rice .\n",
       "[118] While these briefings discussed general\n",
       "[119] threats to attack America and American interests , the specific threats mentioned in\n",
       "[120] these briefings were all overseas .\n",
       "[121] On May 29 , Clarke suggested that Rice ask DCI Tenet what more the United States could\n",
       "[122] do to stop Abu Zubaydah from launching '' a series of major terrorist attacks , ''\n",
       "[123] probably on Israeli targets , but possibly on U.S. facilities .\n",
       "[124] Clarke wrote to Rice\n",
       "[125] and her deputy , Stephen Hadley , `` When these attacks occur , as they likely will , we\n",
       "[126] will wonder what more we could have done to stop them . ''\n",
       "[127] In May , CIA Counterterrorist\n",
       "[128] Center ( CTC ) Chief Cofer Black told Rice that the current threat level was a 7 on a\n",
       "[129] scale of 1 to 10 , as compared to an 8 during the millennium .\n",
       "[130] High Probability of Near-Term `` Spectacular ''\n",
       "[131] Attacks\n",
       "[132] Threat reports surged in June and July , reaching an even higher peak of urgency .\n",
       "[133] The\n",
       "[134] summer threats seemed to be focused on Saudi Arabia , Israel , Bahrain , Kuwait , Yemen ,\n",
       "[135] and possibly Rome , but the danger could be anywhere- including a possible attack on\n",
       "[136] the G-8 summit in Genoa .\n",
       "[137] A June 12 CIA report passing along biographical background\n",
       "[138] information on several terrorists mentioned , in commenting on Khalid Sheikh\n",
       "[139] Mohammed , that he was recruiting people to travel to the United States to meet with\n",
       "[140] colleagues already there so that they might conduct terrorist attacks on Bin Ladin 's\n",
       "[141] behalf .\n",
       "[142] On June 22 , the CIA notified all its station chiefs about intelligence\n",
       "[143] suggesting a possible al Qaeda suicide attack on a U.S. target over the next few\n",
       "[144] days .\n",
       "[145] DCITenet asked that all U.S. ambassadors be briefed .\n",
       "[146] That same day , the State Department notified all embassies of the terrorist threat\n",
       "[147] and updated its worldwide public warning .\n",
       "[148] In June , the State Department initiated\n",
       "[149] the Visa Express program in Saudi Arabia as a security measure , in order to keep\n",
       "[150] long lines of foreigners away from vulnerable embassy spaces .\n",
       "[151] The program permitted\n",
       "[152] visa applications to be made through travel agencies , instead of directly at the\n",
       "[153] embassy or consulate .\n",
       "[154] A terrorist threat advisory distributed in late June indicated a high probability of\n",
       "[155] near-term `` spectacular '' terrorist attacks resulting in numerous casualties .\n",
       "[156] Other\n",
       "[157] reports ' titles warned , '' Bin Ladin Attacks May be Imminent '' and `` Bin Ladin and\n",
       "[158] Associates Making Near-Term Threats . ''\n",
       "[159] The latter reported multiple attacks planned\n",
       "[160] over the coming days , including a `` severe blow '' against U.S. and Israeli `` interests ''\n",
       "[161] during the next two weeks .\n",
       "[162] On June 21 , near the height of the threat reporting , U.S. Central Command raised the\n",
       "[163] force protection condition level for U.S. troops in six countries to the highest\n",
       "[164] possible level , Delta .\n",
       "[165] The U.S. Fifth Fleet moved out of its port in Bahrain , and a\n",
       "[166] U.S. Marine Corps exercise in Jordan was halted . U.S. embassies in the Persian Gulf\n",
       "[167] conducted an emergency security review , and the embassy in Yemen was closed .\n",
       "[168] The CSG\n",
       "[169] had foreign emergency response teams , known as FESTs , ready to move on four hours '\n",
       "[170] notice and kept up the terrorism alert posture on a `` rolling 24 hour basis . ''\n",
       "[171] On June 25 , Clarke warned Rice and Hadley that six separate intelligence reports\n",
       "[172] showed al Qaeda personnel warning of a pending attack .\n",
       "[173] An Arabic television station\n",
       "[174] reported Bin Ladin 's pleasure with al Qaeda leaders who were saying that the next\n",
       "[175] weeks `` will witness important surprises '' and that U.S. and Israeli interests will be\n",
       "[176] targeted .\n",
       "[177] Al Qaeda also released a new recruitment and fund-raising tape .\n",
       "[178] Clarke\n",
       "[179] wrote that this was all too sophisticated to be merely a psychological operation to\n",
       "[180] keep the United States on edge , and the CIA agreed .\n",
       "[181] The intelligence reporting\n",
       "[182] consistently described the upcoming attacks as occurring on a calamitous level,\n",
       "[183] indicating that they would cause the world to be in turmoil and that they would\n",
       "[184] consist of possible multiple-but not necessarily simultaneous-attacks .\n",
       "[185] On June 28 , Clarke wrote Rice that the pattern of al Qaeda activity indicating attack\n",
       "[186] planning over the past six weeks `` had reached a crescendo. '' '' A series of new reports\n",
       "[187] continue to convince me and analysts at State, CIA , DIA [Defense Intelligence\n",
       "[188] Agency ] , and NSA that a major terrorist attack or series of attacks is likely in\n",
       "[189] July , '' he noted .\n",
       "[190] One al Qaeda intelligence report warned that something `` very , very,\n",
       "[191] very , very '' big was about to happen , and most of Bin Ladin 's network was reportedly\n",
       "[192] anticipating the attack .\n",
       "[193] In late June , the CIA ordered all its station chiefs to\n",
       "[194] share information on al Qaeda with their host governments and to push for immediate\n",
       "[195] disruptions of cells .\n",
       "[196] The headline of a June 30 briefing to top officials was stark: '' Bin Ladin Planning\n",
       "[197] High-Profile Attacks . ''\n",
       "[198] The report stated that Bin Ladin operatives expected\n",
       "[199] near-term attacks to have dramatic consequences of catastrophic proportions .\n",
       "[200] That\n",
       "[201] same day , Saudi Arabia declared its highest level of terror alert .\n",
       "[202] Despite evidence\n",
       "[203] of delays possibly caused by heightened U.S. security , the planning for attacks was\n",
       "[204] continuing .\n",
       "[205] On July 2 , the FBI Counterterrorism Division sent a message to federal agencies and\n",
       "[206] state and local law enforcement agencies summarizing information regarding threats\n",
       "[207] from Bin Ladin .\n",
       "[208] It warned that there was an increased volume of threat reporting,\n",
       "[209] indicating a potential for attacks against U.S. targets abroad from groups `` aligned\n",
       "[210] with or sympathetic to Usama Bin Ladin . ''\n",
       "[211] Despite the general warnings , the message\n",
       "[212] further stated , `` The FBI has no information indicating a credible threat of\n",
       "[213] terrorist attack in the United States . ''\n",
       "[214] However , it went on to emphasize that the\n",
       "[215] possibility of attack in the United States could not be discounted .\n",
       "[216] It also noted\n",
       "[217] that the July 4 holiday might heighten the threats .\n",
       "[218] The report asked recipients\n",
       "[219] to '' exercise extreme vigilance '' and `` report suspicious activities '' to the FBI .\n",
       "[220] It did\n",
       "[221] not suggest specific actions that they should take to prevent attacks .\n",
       "[222] Disruption operations against al Qaeda -affiliated cells were launched involving 20\n",
       "[223] countries .\n",
       "[224] Several terrorist operatives were detained by foreign governments,\n",
       "[225] possibly disrupting operations in the Gulf and Italy and perhaps averting attacks\n",
       "[226] against two or three U.S. embassies .\n",
       "[227] Clarke and others told us of a particular\n",
       "[228] concern about possible attacks on the Fourth of July .\n",
       "[229] After it passed uneventfully,\n",
       "[230] the CSG decided to maintain the alert .\n",
       "[231] To enlist more international help , Vice President Cheney contacted Saudi Crown Prince\n",
       "[232] Abdullah on July 5 .\n",
       "[233] Hadley apparently called European counterparts , while Clarke\n",
       "[234] worked with senior officials in the Gulf .\n",
       "[235] In late July , because of threats , Italy\n",
       "[236] closed the airspace over Genoa and mounted antiaircraft batteries at the Genoa\n",
       "[237] airport during the G-8 summit , which President Bush attended .\n",
       "[238] At home , the CSG arranged for the CIA to brief intelligence and security officials\n",
       "[239] from several domestic agencies .\n",
       "[240] On July 5 , representatives from the Immigration and\n",
       "[241] Naturalization Service ( INS ) , the FAA , the Coast Guard , the Secret Service , Customs ,\n",
       "[242] the CIA , and the FBI met with Clarke to discuss the current threat .\n",
       "[243] Attendees report\n",
       "[244] that they were told not to disseminate the threat information they received at the\n",
       "[245] meeting .\n",
       "[246] They interpreted this direction to mean that although they could brief\n",
       "[247] their superiors , they could not send out advisories to the field .\n",
       "[248] An NSC official\n",
       "[249] recalls a somewhat different emphasis , saying that attendees were asked to take the\n",
       "[250] information back to their home agencies and `` do what you can '' with it , subject to\n",
       "[251] classification and distribution restrictions .\n",
       "[252] A representative from the INS asked\n",
       "[253] for a summary of the information that she could share with field offices .\n",
       "[254] She never\n",
       "[255] received one .\n",
       "[256] That same day , the CIA briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on the al Qaeda threat,\n",
       "[257] warning that a significant terrorist attack was imminent .\n",
       "[258] Ashcroft was told that\n",
       "[259] preparations for multiple attacks were in late stages or already complete and that\n",
       "[260] little additional warning could be expected .\n",
       "[261] The briefing addressed only threats\n",
       "[262] outside the United States .\n",
       "[263] The next day , the CIA representative told the CSG that al Qaeda members believed the\n",
       "[264] upcoming attack would be `` spectacular , '' qualitatively different from anything they\n",
       "[265] had done to date .\n",
       "[266] Apparently as a result of the July 5 meeting with Clarke , the interagency committee\n",
       "[267] on federal building security was tasked to examine security measures .\n",
       "[268] This committee\n",
       "[269] met on July 9 , when 37 officials from 27 agencies and organizations were briefed on\n",
       "[270] the `` current threat level '' in the United States .\n",
       "[271] They were told that not only the\n",
       "[272] threat reports from abroad but also the recent convictions in the East Africa\n",
       "[273] bombings trial , the conviction of Ahmed Ressam , and the just-returned KhobarTowers\n",
       "[274] indictments reinforced the need to `` exercise extreme vigilance . ''\n",
       "[275] Attendees were\n",
       "[276] expected to determine whether their respective agencies needed enhanced security\n",
       "[277] measures .\n",
       "[278] On July 18, 2001 , the State Department provided a warning to the public regarding\n",
       "[279] possible terrorist attacks in the Arabian Peninsula .\n",
       "[280] Acting FBI Director Thomas Pickard told us he had one of his periodic conference\n",
       "[281] calls with all special agents in charge on July 19 .\n",
       "[282] He said one of the items he\n",
       "[283] mentioned was the need , in light of increased threat reporting , to have evidence\n",
       "[284] response teams ready to move at a moment 's notice , in case of an attack .\n",
       "[285] He did not task field offices to try to determine whether any plots were being\n",
       "[286] considered within the United States or to take any action to disrupt any such plots .\n",
       "[287] In mid-July , reporting started to indicate that Bin Ladin 's plans had been delayed,\n",
       "[288] maybe for as long as two months , but not abandoned .\n",
       "[289] On July 23 , the lead item for\n",
       "[290] CSG discussion was still the al Qaeda threat , and it included mention of suspected\n",
       "[291] terrorist travel to the United States .\n",
       "[292] On July 31 , an FAA circular appeared alerting the aviation community to `` reports of\n",
       "[293] possible near-term terrorist operations . . . particularly on the Arabian Peninsula\n",
       "[294] and/or Israel . ''\n",
       "[295] It stated that the FAA had no credible evidence of specific plans to\n",
       "[296] attack U.S. civil aviation , though it noted that some of the `` currently active ''\n",
       "[297] terrorist groups were known to `` plan and train for hijackings '' and were able to build\n",
       "[298] and conceal sophisticated explosive devices in luggage and consumer products .\n",
       "[299] Tenet told us that in his world `` the system was blinking red . ''\n",
       "[300] By late July , Tenet\n",
       "[301] said , it could not `` get any worse . ''\n",
       "[302] Not everyone was\n",
       "[303] convinced .\n",
       "[304] Some asked whether all these threats might just be deception .\n",
       "[305] On June 30 ,\n",
       "[306] the SEIB contained an article titled `` Bin Ladin Threats Are Real . ''\n",
       "[307] Yet Hadley told\n",
       "[308] Tenet in July that Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz questioned the\n",
       "[309] reporting .\n",
       "[310] Perhaps Bin Ladin was trying to study U.S. reactions .\n",
       "[311] Tenet replied that\n",
       "[312] he had already addressed the Defense Department 's questions on this point ; the\n",
       "[313] reporting was convincing .\n",
       "[314] To give a sense of his anxiety at the time , one senior\n",
       "[315] official in the Counterterrorist Center told us that he and a colleague were\n",
       "[316] considering resigning in order to go public with their concerns .\n",
       "[317] The Calm Before the Storm\n",
       "[318] On July 27 , Clarke informed Rice and Hadley that the spike in intelligence about a\n",
       "[319] near-term al Qaeda attack had stopped .\n",
       "[320] He urged keeping readiness high during the\n",
       "[321] August vacation period , warning that another report suggested an attack had just\n",
       "[322] been postponed for a few months `` but will still happen . ''\n",
       "[323] On August 1 , the FBI issued an advisory that in light of the increased volume of\n",
       "[324] threat reporting and the upcoming anniversary of the East Africa embassy bombings,\n",
       "[325] increased attention should be paid to security planning .\n",
       "[326] It noted that although most\n",
       "[327] of the reporting indicated a potential for attacks on U.S. interests abroad , the\n",
       "[328] possibility of an attack in the United States could not be discounted .\n",
       "[329] On August 3 , the intelligence community issued an advisory concluding that the threat\n",
       "[330] of impending al Qaeda attacks would likely continue indefinitely .\n",
       "[331] Citing threats in\n",
       "[332] the Arabian Peninsula , Jordan , Israel , and Europe , the advisory suggested that al\n",
       "[333] Qaeda was lying in wait and searching for gaps in security before moving forward\n",
       "[334] with the planned attacks .\n",
       "[335] During the spring and summer of 2001 , President Bush had on several occasions asked\n",
       "[336] his briefers whether any of the threats pointed to the United States .\n",
       "[337] Reflecting on\n",
       "[338] these questions , the CIA decided to write a briefing article summarizing its\n",
       "[339] understanding of this danger .\n",
       "[340] Two CIA analysts involved in preparing this briefing\n",
       "[341] article believed it represented an opportunity to communicate their view that the\n",
       "[342] threat of a Bin Ladin attack in the United States remained both current and\n",
       "[343] serious .\n",
       "[344] The result was an article in the August 6 Presidential Daily Brief titled `` Bin Ladin\n",
       "[345] Determined to Strike in US . ''\n",
       "[346] It was the 36th PDB item briefed so far that year that\n",
       "[347] related to Bin Ladin or al Qaeda , and the first devoted to the possibility of an\n",
       "[348] attack in the United States .\n",
       "[349] The President told us the August 6 report was\n",
       "[350] historical in nature .\n",
       "[351] President Bush said the article told him that al Qaeda was\n",
       "[352] dangerous , which he said he had known since he had become President .\n",
       "[353] The President\n",
       "[354] said Bin Ladin had long been talking about his desire to attack America .\n",
       "[355] He recalled\n",
       "[356] some operational data on the FBI , and remembered thinking it was heartening that 70\n",
       "[357] investigations were under way .\n",
       "[358] As best he could recollect , Rice had mentioned that\n",
       "[359] the Yemenis ' surveillance of a federal building in New York had been looked into in\n",
       "[360] May and June , but there was no actionable intelligence .\n",
       "[361] He did not recall discussing\n",
       "[362] the August 6 report with the Attorney General or whether Rice had done so .\n",
       "[363] He said\n",

       "[424] the United States as a result of this report .\n",
       "[425] Late in the month , a foreign service reported that Abu Zubaydah was considering\n",

       "[428] No targets , timing , or method of attack were provided .\n",

       "[435] But Tenet does not recall\n",
       "[436] any discussions with the President of the domestic threat during this period .\n",
       "[437] Most of the intelligence community recognized in the summer of 2001 that the number\n",
       "[438] and severity of threat reports were unprecedented .\n",
       "[439] Many officials told us that they\n",
       "[440] knew something terrible was planned , and they were desperate to stop it .\n",
       "[441] Despite\n",
       "[442] their large number , the threats received contained few specifics regarding time,\n",
       "[443] place , method , or target .\n",
       "[444] Most suggested that attacks were planned against targets\n",
       "[445] overseas ; others indicated threats against unspecified `` U.S. interests . ''\n",
       "[446] We can not\n",
       "[447] say for certain whether these reports , as dramatic as they were , related to the 9/11\n",
       "[448] attacks .\n",
       "[449] Government Response to the Threats\n",
       "[450] National Security Advisor Rice told us that the CSG was the `` nerve center '' for\n",
       "[451] running the crisis , although other senior officials were involved over the course of\n",
       "[452] the summer .\n",
       "[453] In addition to his daily meetings with President Bush , and weekly\n",
       "[454] meetings to go over other issues with Rice , Tenet was speaking regularly with\n",
       "[455] Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld .\n",
       "[456] The\n",
       "[457] foreign policy principals routinely talked on the telephone every day on a variety\n",
       "[458] of topics .\n",
       "[459] Hadley told us that before 9/11 , he and Rice did not feel they had the job of\n",
       "[460] coordinating domestic agencies .\n",
       "[461] They felt that Clarke and the CSG ( part of the NSC )\n",
       "[462] were the NSC 's bridge between foreign and domestic threats .\n",
       "[463] There was a clear disparity in the levels of response to foreign versus domestic\n",
       "[464] threats .\n",
       "[465] Numerous actions were taken overseas to disrupt possible attacks- enlisting\n",
       "[466] foreign partners to upset terrorist plans , closing embassies , moving military assets\n",
       "[467] out of the way of possible harm .\n",
       "[468] Far less was done domestically- in part , surely,\n",
       "[469] because to the extent that specifics did exist , they pertained to threats overseas .\n",
       "[470] As noted earlier , a threat against the embassy in Yemen quickly resulted in its\n",
       "[471] closing .\n",
       "[472] Possible domestic threats were more vague .\n",
       "[473] When reports did not specify\n",
       "[474] where the attacks were to take place , officials presumed that they would again be\n",
       "[475] overseas , though they did not rule out a target in the United States .\n",
       "[476] Each of the\n",
       "[477] FBI threat advisories made this point .\n",
       "[478] Clarke mentioned to National Security Advisor Rice at least twice that al Qaeda\n",
       "[479] sleeper cells were likely in the United States .\n",
       "[480] In January 2001 , Clarke forwarded a\n",
       "[481] strategy paper to Rice warning that al Qaeda had a presence in the United States .\n",
       "[482] He\n",
       "[483] noted that two key al Qaeda members in the Jordanian cell involved in the millennium\n",
       "[484] plot were naturalized U.S. citizens and that one jihadist suspected in the East\n",
       "[485] Africa bombings had `` informed the FBI that an extensive network of al Qida 'sleeper\n",
       "[486] agents ' currently exists in the US . ''\n",
       "[487] He added that Ressam 's abortive December 1999\n",
       "[488] attack revealed al Qaeda supporters in the United States .\n",
       "[489] His analysis , however , was based not on new threat reporting but on past experience .\n",
       "[490] The September 11 attacks fell into the void between the foreign and domestic threats .\n",
       "[491] The foreign intelligence agencies were watching overseas , alert to foreign threats\n",
       "[492] to U.S. interests there .\n",
       "[493] The domestic agencies were waiting for evidence of a\n",
       "[494] domestic threat from sleeper cells within the United States .\n",
       "[495] No one was looking for\n",
       "[496] a foreign threat to domestic targets .\n",
       "[497] The threat that was coming was not from\n",
       "[498] sleeper cells .\n",
       "[499] It was foreign-but from foreigners who had infiltrated into the\n",
       "[500] United States .\n",
       "[501] A second cause of this disparity in response is that domestic agencies did not know\n",
       "[502] what to do , and no one gave them direction .\n",
       "[503] Cressey told us that the CSG did not\n",
       "[504] tell the agencies how to respond to the threats .\n",
       "[505] He noted that the agencies that\n",
       "[506] were operating overseas did not need direction on how to respond ; they had\n",
       "[507] experience with such threats and had a `` playbook . ''\n",
       "[508] In contrast , the domestic\n",
       "[509] agencies did not have a game plan .\n",
       "[510] Neither the NSC ( including the CSG ) nor anyone\n",
       "[511] else instructed them to create one .\n",
       "[512] This lack of direction was evident in the July 5 meeting with representatives from\n",
       "[513] the domestic agencies .\n",
       "[514] The briefing focused on overseas threats .\n",
       "[515] The domestic\n",
       "[516] agencies were not questioned about how they planned to address the threat and were\n",
       "[517] not told what was expected of them .\n",
       "[518] Indeed , as noted earlier , they were specifically\n",
       "[519] told they could not issue advisories based on the briefing .\n",
       "[520] 46 The domestic\n",
       "[521] agencies ' limited response indicates that they did not perceive a call to action .\n",
       "[522] Clarke reflected a different perspective in an email to Rice on September 15, 2001 .\n",
       "[523] He summarized the steps taken by the CSG to alert domestic agencies to the\n",
       "[524] possibility of an attack in the United States .\n",
       "[525] Clarke concluded that domestic\n",
       "[526] agencies , including the FAA , knew that the CSG believed a major al Qaeda attack was\n",
       "[527] coming and could be in the United States .\n",
       "[528] Although the FAA had authority to issue security directives mandating new security\n",
       "[529] procedures , none of the few that were released during the summer of 2001 increased\n",
       "[530] security at checkpoints or on board aircraft .\n",
       "[531] The information circulars mostly urged\n",
       "[532] air carriers to `` exercise prudence '' and be alert .\n",
       "[533] Prior to 9/11 , the FAA did present\n",
       "[534] a CD-ROM to air carriers and airport authorities describing the increased threat to\n",
       "[535] civil aviation .\n",
       "[536] The presentation mentioned the possibility of suicide hijackings but\n",
       "[537] said that `` fortunately , we have no indication that any group is currently thinking\n",
       "[538] in that direction . ''\n",
       "[539] The FAA conducted 27 special security\n",
       "[540] briefings for specific air carriers between May 1, 2001 , and September 11, 2001 .\n",
       "[541] Two\n",
       "[542] of these briefings discussed the hijacking threat overseas .\n",
       "[543] None discussed the\n",
       "[544] possibility of suicide hijackings or the use of aircraft as weapons .\n",
       "[545] No new security\n",
       "[546] measures were instituted .\n",
       "[547] Rice told us she understood that the FBI had tasked its 56 U.S. field offices to\n",
       "[548] increase surveillance of suspected terrorists and to reach out to informants who\n",
       "[549] might have information about terrorist plots .\n",
       "[550] An NSC staff document at the time\n",
       "[551] describes such a tasking as having occurred in late June but does not indicate\n",
       "[552] whether it was generated by the NSC or the FBI .\n",
       "[553] Other than the previously described\n",
       "[554] April 13 communication sent to all FBI field offices , however , the FBI could not\n",
       "[555] find any record of having received such a directive .\n",
       "[556] The April 13 document asking\n",
       "[557] field offices to gather information on Sunni extremism did not mention any possible\n",
       "[558] threat within the United States and did not order surveillance of suspected\n",
       "[559] operatives .\n",
       "[560] The NSC did not specify what the FBI 's directives should contain and did\n",
       "[561] not review what had been issued earlier .\n",
       "[562] Acting FBI Director Pickard told us that in addition to his July 19 conference call,\n",
       "[563] he mentioned the heightened terrorist threat in individual calls with the special\n",
       "[564] agents in charge of field offices during their annual performance review\n",
       "[565] discussions .\n",
       "[566] In speaking with agents around the country , we found little evidence\n",
       "[567] that any such concerns had reached FBI personnel beyond the New York Field\n",
       "[568] Office .\n",
       "[569] The head of counterterrorism at the FBI , Dale Watson , said he had many discussions\n",
       "[570] about possible attacks with Cofer Black at the CIA .\n",
       "[571] They had expected an attack on\n",
       "[572] July 4 .\n",
       "[573] Watson said he felt deeply that something was going to happen .\n",
       "[574] But he told\n",
       "[575] us the threat information was `` nebulous . ''\n",
       "[576] He wished he had known more .\n",
       "[577] He wished he\n",
       "[578] had had `` 500 analysts looking at Usama Bin Ladin threat information instead of\n",
       "[579] two . ''\n",
       "[580] Attorney General Ashcroft was briefed by the CIA in May and by Pickard in early July\n",
       "[581] about the danger .\n",
       "[582] Pickard said he met with Ashcroft once a week in late June ,\n",
       "[583] through July , and twice in August .\n",
       "[584] There is a dispute regarding Ashcroft 's interest\n",
       "[585] in Pickard 's briefings about the terrorist threat situation .\n",
       "[586] Pickard told us that\n",
       "[587] after two such briefings Ashcroft told him that he did not want to hear about the\n",
       "[588] threats anymore .\n",
       "[589] Ashcroft denies Pickard 's charge .\n",
       "[590] Pickard says he continued to\n",
       "[591] present terrorism information during further briefings that summer , but nothing\n",
       "[592] further on the `` chatter '' the U.S. government was receiving .\n",
       "[593] The Attorney General told us he asked Pickard whether there was intelligence about\n",
       "[594] attacks in the United States and that Pickard said no . Pickard said he replied that\n",
       "[595] he could not assure Ashcroft that there would be no attacks in the United States ,\n",
       "[596] although the reports of threats were related to overseas targets .\n",
       "[597] Ashcroft said he\n",
       "[598] therefore assumed the FBI was doing what it needed to do .\n",
       "[599] He acknowledged that in\n",
       "[600] retrospect , this was a dangerous assumption .\n",
       "[601] He did not ask the FBI what it was\n",
       "[602] doing in response to the threats and did not task it to take any specific action .\n",
       "[603] He\n",
       "[604] also did not direct the INS , then still part of the Department of Justice , to take\n",
       "[605] any specific action .\n",
       "[606] In sum , the domestic agencies never mobilized in response to the threat .\n",
       "[607] They did not\n",
       "[608] have direction , and did not have a plan to institute .\n",
       "[609] The borders were not hardened .\n",
       "[610] Transportation systems were not fortified .\n",
       "[611] Electronic surveillance was not targeted\n",
       "[612] against a domestic threat .\n",
       "[613] State and local law enforcement were not marshaled to augment the FBI 's efforts .\n",
       "[614] The\n",
       "[615] public was not warned .\n",
       "[616] The terrorists exploited deep institutional failings within our government .\n",
       "[617] The\n",
       "[618] question is whether extra vigilance might have turned up an opportunity to disrupt\n",
       "[619] the plot .\n",
       "[620] As seen in chapter 7 , al Qaeda's operatives made mistakes .\n",
       "[621] At least two\n",
       "[622] such mistakes created opportunities during 2001 , especially in late August .\n",
       "[623] LATE LEADS-MIHDHAR , MOUSSAOUI , AND KSM\n",
       "[624] In chapter 6 we discussed how intelligence agencies successfully detected some of the\n",
       "[625] early travel in the planes operation , picking up the movements of Khalid al Mihdhar\n",
       "[626] and identifying him , and seeing his travel converge with someone they perhaps could\n",
       "[627] have identified but did not- Nawaf al Hazmi -as well as with less easily identifiable\n",
       "[628] people such as Khallad and Abu Bara .\n",
       "[629] These observations occurred in December 1999\n",
       "[630] and January 2000 .\n",
       "[631] The trail had been lost in January 2000 without a clear\n",
       "[632] realization that it had been lost , and without much effort to pick it up again .\n",
       "[633] Nor\n",
       "[634] had the CIA placed Mihdhar on the State Department 's watchlist for suspected\n",
       "[635] terrorists , so that either an embassy or a port of entry might take note if Mihdhar\n",
       "[636] showed up again .\n",
       "[637] On four occasions in 2001 , the CIA , the FBI , or both had apparent opportunities to\n",
       "[638] refocus on the significance of Hazmi and Mihdhar and reinvigorate the search for\n",
       "[639] them .\n",
       "[640] After reviewing those episodes we will turn to the handling of the Moussaoui\n",
       "[641] case and some late leads regarding Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .\n",
       "[642] January 2001 : Identification of Khallad\n",
       "[643] Almost one year after the original trail had been lost in Bangkok , the FBI and the\n",
       "[644] CIA were working on the investigation of the Cole bombing .\n",
       "[645] They learned of the link\n",
       "[646] between a captured conspirator and a person called `` Khallad . ''\n",
       "[647] They also learned that\n",
       "[648] Khallad was a senior security official for Bin Ladin who had helped direct the\n",
       "[649] bombing ( we introduced Khallad in chapter 5 , and returned to his role in the Cole\n",
       "[650] bombing in chapter 6 ) .55 One of the members of the FBI 's investigative team in Yemen\n",
       "[651] realized that he had heard of Khallad before , from a joint FBI / CIA source four\n",
       "[652] months earlier .\n",
       "[653] The FBI agent obtained from a foreign government a photo of the\n",
       "[654] person believed to have directed the Cole bombing .\n",
       "[655] It was shown to the source , and\n",
       "[656] he confirmed that the man in that photograph was the same Khallad he had\n",
       "[657] described .\n",
       "[658] In December 2000 , on the basis of some links associated with Khalid al Mihdhar , the\n",
       "[659] CIA 's Bin Ladin unit speculated that Khallad and Khalid al Mihdhar might be one and\n",
       "[660] the same .\n",
       "[661] The CIA asked that a Kuala Lumpur surveillance photo of Mihdhar be shown to the joint\n",
       "[662] source who had identified Khallad .\n",
       "[663] In early January 2001 , two photographs from the\n",
       "[664] Kuala Lumpur meeting were shown to the source .\n",
       "[665] One was a known photograph of\n",
       "[666] Mihdhar , the other a photograph of a then unknown subject .\n",
       "[667] The source did not\n",
       "[668] recognize Mihdhar .\n",

       "[670] individual was Khallad .\n",
       "[671] This meant that Khallad and Mihdhar were two different people .\n",
       "[672] It also meant that\n",
       "[673] there was a link between Khallad and Mihdhar , making Mihdhar seem even more\n",
       "[674] suspicious.59Yet we found no effort by the CIA to renew the long-abandoned search\n",
       "[675] for Mihdhar or his travel companions .\n",
       "[676] In addition , we found that the CIA did not notify the FBI of this identification .\n",
       "[677] DCITenet and Cofer Black testified before Congress 's Joint Inquiry into 9/11 that\n",
       "[678] the FBI had access to this identification from the beginning .\n",
       "[679] But drawing on an\n",
       "[680] extensive record , including documents that were not available to the CIA personnel\n",
       "[681] who drafted that testimony , we conclude this was not the case .\n",
       "[682] The FBI 's primary\n",
       "[683] Cole investigators had no knowledge that Khallad had been in Kuala Lumpur with\n",
       "[684] Mihdhar and others until after the September 11 attacks .\n",
       "[685] Because the FBI had not\n",
       "[686] been informed in January 2000 about Mihdhar 's possession of a U.S. visa , it had not\n",
       "[687] then started looking for him in the United States .\n",

       "[691] This incident is an example of how day-to-day gaps in information sharing can emerge\n",
       "[692] even when there is mutual goodwill .\n",

       "[696] Issues of travel and security necessarily kept short\n",
       "[697] the amount of time spent with the source .\n",
       "[698] As a result , the CIA officer usually did\n",
       "[699] not translate either questions or answers for his FBI colleague and friend .\n",
       "[700] For interviews without simultaneous translation , the FBI agent on the scene received\n",
       "[701] copies of the reports that the CIA disseminated to other agencies regarding the\n",
       "[702] interviews .\n",
       "[703] But he was not given access to the CIA 's internal operational reports,\n",
       "[704] which contained more detail .\n",
       "[705] It was there-in reporting to which FBI investigators\n",
       "[706] did not have access-that information regarding the January 2001 identification of\n",
       "[707] Khallad appeared .\n",
       "[708] The CIA officer does not recall this particular identification and\n",
       "[709] thus can not say why it was not shared with his FBI colleague .\n",
       "[710] He might not have\n",
       "[711] understood the possible significance of the new identification .\n",
       "[712] In June 2000 , Mihdhar left California and returned to Yemen .\n",

       "[715] Department's TIPOFF watchlist , or provided the FBI with the information , he might\n",
       "[716] have been found-either before or at the time he applied for a new visa in June 2001 ,\n",

       "[725] information regarding the travel .\n",
       "[726] On May 15 , he and an official at the CIA\n",
       "[727] reexamined many of the old cables from early 2000 , including the information that\n",

       "[729] 2000 .\n",
       "[730] The CIA official who reviewed the cables took no action regarding them .\n",

       "[782] Because the CIA had not disseminated reports on its\n",
       "[783] tracking of Mihdhar , `` Jane '' did not pull up any information about Mihdhar 's U.S. visa\n",

       "[802] Therefore `` Jane '' concluded that she could not pass on information from those\n",
       "[803] reports to the agents .\n",
       "[804] This decision was potentially significant , because the\n",
       "[805] signals intelligence she did not share linked Mihdhar to a suspected terrorist\n",

       "[876] As the\n",
       "[877] information indicated that Mihdhar had last arrived in New York , she began drafting\n",

       "[879] A lead relays\n",
       "[880] information from one part of the FBI to another and requests that a particular\n",
       "[881] action be taken .\n",
       "[882] She called an agent in New York to give him a `` headsup '' on the\n",
       "[883] matter , but her draft lead was not sent until August 28 .\n",
       "[884] Her email told the New York\n",
       "[885] agent that she wanted him to get started as soon as possible , but she labeled the\n",
       "[886] lead as `` Routine '' -a designation that informs the receiving office that it has 30\n",
       "[887] days to respond .\n",
       "[888] The agent who received the lead forwarded it to his squad supervisor .\n",
       "[889] That same day,\n",
       "[890] the supervisor forwarded the lead to an intelligence agent to open an intelligence\n",
       "[891] case-an agent who thus was behind `` the wall '' keeping FBI intelligence information\n",
       "[892] from being shared with criminal prosecutors .\n",
       "[893] He also sent it to the Cole case agents\n",
       "[894] and an agent who had spent significant time in Malaysia searching for another\n",
       "[895] Khalid : Khalid Sheikh Mohammad .\n",
       "[896] The suggested goal of the investigation was to locate Mihdhar , determine his contacts\n",
       "[897] and reasons for being in the United States , and possibly conduct an interview .\n",
       "[898] Before sending the lead , `` Jane '' had discussed it with `` John , '' the CIA official on\n",
       "[899] detail to the FBI .\n",
       "[900] She had also checked with the acting head of the FBI 's Bin Ladin\n",
       "[901] unit .\n",
       "[902] The discussion seems to have been limited to whether the search should be\n",
       "[903] classified as an intelligence investigation or as a criminal one .\n",
       "[904] It appears that no\n",
       "[905] one informed higher levels of management in either the FBI or CIA about the\n",
       "[906] case .\n",
       "[907] There is no evidence that the lead , or the search for these terrorist suspects , was\n",
       "[908] substantively discussed at any level above deputy chief of a section within the\n",
       "[909] Counterterrorism Division at FBI headquarters .\n",
       "[910] One of the Cole case agents read the lead with interest , and contacted `` Jane '' to\n",
       "[911] obtain more information . ''\n",
       "[912] Jane '' argued , however , that because the agent was\n",
       "[913] designated a `` criminal ''\n",
       "[914] FBI agent , not an intelligence FBI agent , the wall kept him\n",
       "[915] from participating in any search for Mihdhar .\n",
       "[916] In fact , she felt he had to destroy\n",
       "[917] his copy of the lead because it contained NSA information from reports that included\n",
       "[918] caveats ordering that the information not be shared without OIPR 's permission .\n",
       "[919] The\n",
       "[920] agent asked `` Jane '' to get an opinion from the FBI 's National Security Law Unit\n",
       "[921] ( NSLU ) on whether he could open a criminal case on Mihdhar .\n",
       "[922] '' Jane '' sent an email to the Cole case agent explaining that according to the NSLU ,\n",
       "[923] the case could be opened only as an intelligence matter , and that if Mihdhar was\n",
       "[924] found , only designated intelligence agents could conduct or even be present at any\n",
       "[925] interview .\n",
       "[926] She appears to have misunderstood the complex rules that could apply to\n",
       "[927] this situation .\n",
       "[928] The FBI agent angrily responded:\n",
       "[929] Whatever has happened to this-someday someone will die-and wall or not-the\n",
       "[930] public will not understand why we were not more effective and throwing every\n",
       "[931] resource we had at certain `` problems . ''\n",
       "[932] Let 's hope the National Security Law Unit\n",
       "[933] will stand behind their decisions then , especially since the biggest threat to\n",
       "[934] us now , UBL , is getting the most `` protection . ''\n",
       "[935] '' Jane\" replied that she was not making up the rules ; she claimed that they were in\n",
       "[936] the relevant manual and `` ordered by the [ FISA ] Court and every office of the FBI is\n",
       "[937] required to follow them including FBI NY . ''\n",
       "[938] It is now clear that everyone involved was confused about the rules governing the\n",
       "[939] sharing and use of information gathered in intelligence channels .\n",
       "[940] Because Mihdhar\n",
       "[941] was being sought for his possible connection to or knowledge of the Cole bombing , he\n",
       "[942] could be investigated or tracked under the existing Cole criminal case .\n",
       "[943] No new\n",
       "[944] criminal case was needed for the criminal agent to begin searching for Mihdhar .\n",
       "[945] And\n",
       "[946] as NSA had approved the passage of its information to the criminal agent , he could\n",
       "[947] have conducted a search using all available information .\n",
       "[948] As a result of this\n",
       "[949] confusion , the criminal agents who were knowledgeable about al Qaeda and experienced\n",
       "[950] with criminal investigative techniques , including finding suspects and possible\n",
       "[951] criminal charges , were thus excluded from the search .\n",
       "[952] The search was assigned to one FBI agent , and it was his very first counterterrorism\n",
       "[953] lead .\n",
       "[954] Because the lead was `` routine , '' he was given 30 days to open an intelligence\n",
       "[955] case and make some unspecified efforts to locate Mihdhar .\n",
       "[956] He started the process a\n",
       "[957] few days later .\n",
       "[958] He checked local New York databases for criminal record and driver 's\n",
       "[959] license information and checked the hotel listed on Mihdhar 's U.S. entry form .\n",
       "[960] Finally , on September 11 , the agent sent a lead to Los Angeles , because Mihdhar had\n",
       "[961] initially arrived in Los Angeles in January 2000 .\n",
       "[962] We believe that if more resources had been applied and a significantly different\n",
       "[963] approach taken , Mihdhar and Hazmi might have been found .\n",
       "[964] They had used their true\n",
       "[965] names in the United States .\n",
       "[966] Still , the investigators would have needed luck as well\n",
       "[967] as skill to find them prior to September 11 even if such searches had begun as early\n",

       "[969] Many FBI witnesses have suggested that even if Mihdhar had been found , there was\n",
       "[970] nothing the agents could have done except follow him onto the planes .\n",
       "[971] We believe\n",
       "[972] this is incorrect .\n",
       "[973] Both Hazmi and Mihdhar could have been held for immigration\n",

       "[975] Investigation or\n",
       "[976] interrogation of them , and investigation of their travel and financial activities,\n",
       "[977] could have yielded evidence of connections to other participants in the 9/11 plot .\n",

       "[981] Phoenix Memo\n",
       "[982] The Phoenix memo was investigated thoroughly by the Joint Inquiry and the Department\n",
       "[983] of Justice Inspector General.86We will recap it briefly here .\n",
       "[984] In July 2001 , an FBI\n",
       "[985] agent in the Phoenix field office sent a memo to FBI headquarters and to two agents\n",
       "[986] on international terrorism squads in the New York Field Office , advising of the\n",
       "[987] '' possibility of a coordinated effort by Usama Bin Ladin '' to send students to the\n",
       "[988] United States to attend civil aviation schools .\n",
       "[989] The agent based his theory on the\n",
       "[990] '' inordinate number of individuals of investigative interest '' attending such schools\n",
       "[991] in Arizona .\n",
       "[992] The agent made four recommendations to FBI headquarters : to compile a list of civil\n",
       "[993] aviation schools , establish liaison with those schools , discuss his theories about\n",
       "[994] Bin Ladin with the intelligence community , and seek authority to obtain visa\n",
       "[995] information on persons applying to flight schools .\n",
       "[996] His recommendations were not\n",
       "[997] acted on .\n",
       "[998] His memo was forwarded to one field office .\n",
       "[999] Managers of the Usama Bin\n",
       "[1000] Ladin unit and the Radical Fundamentalist unit at FBI headquarters were addressees,\n",
       "[1001] but they did not even see the memo until after September 11 .\n",
       "[1002] No managers at\n",
       "[1003] headquarters saw the memo before September 11 , and the New York Field Office took no\n",
       "[1004] action .\n",
       "[1005] As its author told investigators , the Phoenix memo was not an alert about suicide\n",
       "[1006] pilots .\n",
       "[1007] His worry was more about a Pan Am Flight 103 scenario in which explosives\n",
       "[1008] were placed on an aircraft .\n",
       "[1009] The memo 's references to aviation training were broad,\n",
       "[1010] including aeronautical engineering .\n",
       "[1011] If the memo had been distributed in a timely fashion and its recommendations acted on\n",
       "[1012] promptly , we do not believe it would have uncovered the plot .\n",
       "[1013] It might well,\n",
       "[1014] however , have sensitized the FBI so that it might have taken the Moussaoui matter\n",
       "[1015] more seriously the next month .\n",
       "[1016] Zacarias Moussaoui\n",
       "[1017] On August 15, 2001 , the Minneapolis FBI Field Office initiated an intelligence\n",
       "[1018] investigation on Zacarias Moussaoui .\n",
       "[1019] As mentioned in chapter 7 , he had entered the\n",
       "[1020] United States in February 2001 , and had begun flight lessons at Airman Flight School\n",
       "[1021] in Norman , Oklahoma .\n",
       "[1022] He resumed his training at the Pan Am International Flight\n",
       "[1023] Academy in Eagan , Minnesota , starting on August 13 .\n",
       "[1024] He had none of the usual\n",
       "[1025] qualifications for flight training on Pan Am 's Boeing 747 flight simulators .\n",
       "[1026] He said\n",
       "[1027] he did not intend to become a commercial pilot but wanted the training as an `` ego\n",
       "[1028] boosting thing . ''\n",
       "[1029] Moussaoui stood out because , with little knowledge of flying , he\n",
       "[1030] wanted to learn how to `` take off and land '' a Boeing 747 .\n",
       "[1031] The agent in Minneapolis quickly learned that Moussaoui possessed jihadist beliefs .\n",
       "[1032] Moreover , Moussaoui had $32,000 in a bank account but did not provide a plausible\n",
       "[1033] explanation for this sum of money .\n",
       "[1034] He had traveled to Pakistan but became agitated\n",
       "[1035] when asked if he had traveled to nearby countries while in Pakistan ( Pakistan was\n",
       "[1036] the customary route to the training camps in Afghanistan ) .\n",
       "[1037] He planned to receive\n",
       "[1038] martial arts training , and intended to purchase a global positioning receiver .\n",
       "[1039] The\n",
       "[1040] agent also noted that Moussaoui became extremely agitated whenever he was questioned\n",
       "[1041] regarding his religious beliefs .\n",
       "[1042] The agent concluded that Moussaoui was `` an Islamic\n",
       "[1043] extremist preparing for some future act in furtherance of radical fundamentalist\n",
       "[1044] goals . ''\n",
       "[1045] He also believed Moussaoui 's plan was related to his flight training .\n",
       "[1046] Moussaoui can be seen as an al Qaeda mistake and a missed opportunity .\n",
       "[1047] An apparently\n",
       "[1048] unreliable operative , he had fallen into the hands of the FBI .\n",
       "[1049] As discussed in\n",
       "[1050] chapter 7 , Moussaoui had been in contact with and received money from Ramzi\n",
       "[1051] Binalshibh .\n",
       "[1052] If Moussaoui had been connected to al Qaeda , questions should instantly\n",
       "[1053] have arisen about a possible al Qaeda plot that involved piloting airliners , a\n",
       "[1054] possibility that had never been seriously analyzed by the intelligence community .\n",
       "[1055] The FBI agent who handled the case in conjunction with the INS representative on the\n",
       "[1056] Minneapolis Joint Terrorism Task Force suspected that Moussaoui might be planning to\n",
       "[1057] hijack a plane .\n",
       "[1058] Minneapolis and FBI headquarters debated whether Moussaoui should be\n",
       "[1059] arrested immediately or surveilled to obtain additional information .\n",
       "[1060] Because it was\n",
       "[1061] not clear whether Moussaoui could be imprisoned , the FBI case agent decided the most\n",
       "[1062] important thing was to prevent Moussaoui from obtaining any further training that he\n",
       "[1063] could use to carry out a potential attack .\n",
       "[1064] As a French national who had overstayed his visa , Moussaoui could be detained\n",
       "[1065] immediately .\n",
       "[1066] The INS arrested Moussaoui on the immigration violation .\n",
       "[1067] A deportation\n",
       "[1068] order was signed on August 17, 2001 .\n",
       "[1069] The agents in Minnesota were concerned that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Minneapolis\n",
       "[1070] would find insufficient probable cause of a crime to obtain a criminal warrant to\n",
       "[1071] search Moussaoui 's laptop computer .\n",
       "[1072] Agents at FBI headquarters believed there was insufficient probable cause .\n",
       "[1073] Minneapolis therefore sought a special warrant under the Foreign Intelligence\n",
       "[1074] Surveillance Act to conduct the search ( we introduced FISA in chapter 3 ) .\n",
       "[1075] To do so , however , the FBI needed to demonstrate probable cause that Moussaoui was an\n",
       "[1076] agent of a foreign power , a demonstration that was not required to obtain a criminal\n",
       "[1077] warrant but was a statutory requirement for a FISA warrant .\n",
       "[1078] The case agent did not have sufficient information to connect Moussaoui to a `` foreign\n",
       "[1079] power , '' so he reached out for help , in the United States and overseas .\n",
       "[1080] The FBI agent 's August 18 message requested assistance from the FBI legal attach� in\n",
       "[1081] Paris .\n",
       "[1082] Moussaoui had lived in London , so the Minneapolis agent sought assistance\n",
       "[1083] from the legal attach� there as well .\n",
       "[1084] By August 24 , the Minneapolis agent had also\n",
       "[1085] contacted an FBI detailee and a CIA desk officer at the Counterterrorist Center\n",
       "[1086] about the case .\n",
       "[1087] The FBI legal attach� 's office in Paris first contacted the French government on\n",
       "[1088] August 16 or 17 , shortly after speaking to the Minneapolis case agent on the\n",
       "[1089] telephone .\n",
       "[1090] On August 22 and 27 , the French provided information that made a\n",
       "[1091] connection between Moussaoui and a rebel leader in Chechnya , Ibn al Khattab .\n",
       "[1092] This\n",
       "[1093] set off a spirited debate between the Minneapolis Field Office , FBI headquarters,\n",
       "[1094] and the CIA as to whether the Chechen rebels and Khattab were sufficiently\n",
       "[1095] associated with a terrorist organization to constitute a `` foreign power '' for\n",
       "[1096] purposes of the FISA statute .\n",
       "[1097] FBI headquarters did not believe this was good enough,\n",
       "[1098] and its National Security Law Unit declined to submit a FISA application .\n",
       "[1099] After receiving the written request for assistance , the legal attach� in London had\n",
       "[1100] promptly forwarded it to his counterparts in the British government , hand-delivering\n",
       "[1101] the request on August 21 .\n",
       "[1102] On August 24 , the CIA also sent a cable to London and\n",
       "[1103] Paris regarding `` subjects involved in suspicious 747 flight training '' that described\n",
       "[1104] Moussaoui as a possible `` suicide hijacker . ''\n",
       "[1105] On August 28 , the CIA sent a request for\n",
       "[1106] information to a different service of the British government ; this communication\n",
       "[1107] warned that Moussaoui might be expelled to Britain by the end of August .\n",
       "[1108] The FBI\n",
       "[1109] office in London raised the matter briefly with British officials as an aside , after\n",
       "[1110] a meeting about a more urgent matter on September 3 , and sent the British service a\n",
       "[1111] written update on September 5 .\n",
       "[1112] The case was not handled by the British as a priority\n",
       "[1113] amid a large number of other terrorist-related inquiries .\n",
       "[1114] On September 4 , the FBI sent a teletype to the CIA , the FAA , the Customs Service , the\n",
       "[1115] State Department , the INS , and the Secret Service summarizing the known facts\n",
       "[1116] regarding Moussaoui .\n",
       "[1117] It did not report the case agent 's personal assessment that\n",
       "[1118] Moussaoui planned to hijack an airplane .\n",
       "[1119] It did contain the FAA 's comment that it\n",
       "[1120] was not unusual for Middle Easterners to attend flight training schools in the\n",
       "[1121] United States .\n",
       "[1122] Although the Minneapolis agents wanted to tell the FAA from the beginning about\n",
       "[1123] Moussaoui , FBI headquarters instructed Minneapolis that it could not share the more\n",
       "[1124] complete report the case agent had prepared for the FAA .\n",
       "[1125] The Minneapolis supervisor\n",
       "[1126] sent the case agent in person to the local FAA office to fill in what he thought\n",
       "[1127] were gaps in the FBI headquarters teletype .\n",
       "[1128] No FAA actions seem to have been taken in response .\n",
       "[1129] There was substantial disagreement between Minneapolis agents and FBI headquarters as\n",
       "[1130] to what Moussaoui was planning to do .\n",
       "[1131] In one conversation between a Minneapolis\n",
       "[1132] supervisor and a headquarters agent , the latter complained that Minneapolis 's FISA\n",
       "[1133] request was couched in a manner intended to get people `` spun up . ''\n",
       "[1134] The supervisor\n",
       "[1135] replied that was precisely his intent .\n",
       "[1136] He said he was `` trying to keep someone from\n",
       "[1137] taking a plane and crashing into the World Trade Center . ''\n",
       "[1138] The headquarters agent\n",
       "[1139] replied that this was not going to happen and that they did not know if Moussaoui\n",
       "[1140] was a terrorist .\n",
       "[1141] There is no evidence that either FBI Acting Director Pickard or Assistant Director\n",
       "[1142] for Counterterrorism Dale Watson was briefed on the Moussaoui case prior to 9/11 .\n",
       "[1143] Michael Rolince , the FBI assistant director heading the Bureau 's\n",
       "[1144] InternationalTerrorism Operations Section ( ITOS ) , recalled being told about\n",
       "[1145] Moussaoui in two passing hallway conversations but only in the context that he might\n",
       "[1146] be receiving telephone calls from Minneapolis complaining about how headquarters was\n",
       "[1147] handling the matter .\n",
       "[1148] He never received such a call .\n",
       "[1149] Although the acting special\n",
       "[1150] agent in charge of Minneapolis called the ITOS supervisors to discuss the Moussaoui\n",
       "[1151] case on August 27 , he declined to go up the chain of command at FBI headquarters and\n",
       "[1152] call Rolince .\n",
       "[1153] On August 23 , DCI Tenet was briefed about the Moussaoui case in a briefing titled\n",
       "[1154] '' Islamic Extremist Learns to Fly . ''\n",
       "[1155] Tenet was also told\n",
       "[1156] that Moussaoui wanted to learn to fly a 747 , paid for his training in cash , was\n",
       "[1157] interested to learn the doors do not open in flight , and wanted to fly a simulated\n",
       "[1158] flight from London to New York .\n",
       "[1159] He was told that the FBI had arrested Moussaoui\n",
       "[1160] because of a visa overstay and that the CIA was working the case with the FBI .\n",
       "[1161] Tenet\n",
       "[1162] told us that no connection to al Qaeda was apparent to him at the time .\n",
       "[1163] Seeing it as\n",
       "[1164] an FBI case , he did not discuss the matter with anyone at the White House or the\n",
       "[1165] FBI .\n",
       "[1166] No connection was made between Moussaoui 's presence in the United States and\n",
       "[1167] the threat reporting during the summer of 2001 .\n",
       "[1168] On September 11 , after the attacks , the FBI office in London renewed their appeal for\n",
       "[1169] information about Moussaoui .\n",
       "[1170] In response to U.S. requests , the British government\n",
       "[1171] supplied some basic biographical information about Moussaoui .\n",
       "[1172] The British government\n",
       "[1173] informed us that it also immediately tasked intelligence collection facilities for\n",
       "[1174] information about Moussaoui .\n",
       "[1175] On September 13 , the British government received new,\n",
       "[1176] sensitive intelligence that Moussaoui had attended an al Qaeda training camp in\n",
       "[1177] Afghanistan .\n",
       "[1178] It passed this intelligence to the United States on the same day .\n",
       "[1179] Had\n",
       "[1180] this information been available in late August 2001 , the Moussaoui case would almost\n",
       "[1181] certainly have received intense , high-level attention .\n",
       "[1182] The FBI also learned after 9/11 that the millennium terrorist Ressam , who by 2001 was\n",
       "[1183] cooperating with investigators , recognized Moussaoui as someone who had been in the\n",
       "[1184] Afghan camps .\n",
       "[1185] As mentioned above , before 9/11 the FBI agents in Minneapolis had failed to persuade\n",
       "[1186] supervisors at headquarters that there was enough evidence to seek a FISA warrant to\n",
       "[1187] search Moussaoui 's computer hard drive and belongings .\n",
       "[1188] Either the British\n",
       "[1189] information or the Ressam identification would have broken the logjam .\n",
       "[1190] A maximum U.S. effort to investigate Moussaoui conceivably could have unearthed his\n",
       "[1191] connections to Binalshibh .\n",
       "[1192] Those connections might have brought investigators to the\n",
       "[1193] core of the 9/11 plot .\n",
       "[1194] The Binalshibh connection was recognized shortly after 9/11,\n",
       "[1195] though it was not an easy trail to find .\n",
       "[1196] Discovering it would have required quick\n",
       "[1197] and very substantial cooperation from the German government , which might well have\n",
       "[1198] been difficult to obtain .\n",
       "[1199] However , publicity about Moussaoui 's arrest and a possible\n",
       "[1200] hijacking threat might have derailed the plot.107With time , the search for Mihdhar\n",
       "[1201] and Hazmi and the investigation of Moussaoui might also have led to a breakthrough\n",
       "[1202] that would have disrupted the plot .\n",
       "[1203] Khalid Sheikh Mohammed\n",
       "[1204] Another late opportunity was presented by a confluence of information regarding\n",
       "[1205] Khalid Sheikh Mohammed received by the intelligence community in the summer of 2001 .\n",
       "[1206] The possible links between KSM , Moussaoui , and an individual only later identified\n",
       "[1207] as Ramzi Binalshibh would remain undiscovered , however .\n",
       "[1208] Although we readily equate KSM with al Qaeda today , this was not the case before\n",
       "[1209] 9/11 .\n",
       "[1210] KSM , who had been indicted in January 1996 for his role in the Manila air\n",
       "[1211] plot , was seen primarily as another freelance terrorist , associated with Ramzi\n",
       "[1212] Yousef .\n",
       "[1213] Because the links between KSM and Bin Ladin or al Qaeda were not recognized\n",
       "[1214] at the time , responsibility for KSM remained in the small Islamic Extremist Branch\n",
       "[1215] of the Counterterrorist Center , not in the Bin Ladin unit .\n",
       "[1216] Moreover , because KSM had already been indicted , he became targeted for arrest .\n",
       "[1217] In\n",
       "[1218] 1997 , the Counterterrorist Center added a Renditions Branch to help find wanted\n",
       "[1219] fugitives .\n",
       "[1220] Responsibility for KSM was transferred to this branch , which gave the CIA\n",
       "[1221] a `` man-to-man '' focus but was not an analytical unit .\n",
       "[1222] When subsequent information\n",
       "[1223] came , more critical for analysis than for tracking , no unit had the job of following\n",
       "[1224] up on what the information might mean .\n",
       "[1225] For example , in September 2000 , a source had reported that an individual named Khalid\n",
       "[1226] al-Shaykh al-Ballushi was a key lieutenant in al Qaeda .\n",
       "[1227] Al- Ballushi means `` from\n",
       "[1228] Baluchistan , '' and KSM is from Baluchistan .\n",
       "[1229] Recognizing the possible significance of\n",
       "[1230] this information , the Bin Ladin unit sought more information .\n",
       "[1231] When no information\n",
       "[1232] was forthcoming , the Bin Ladin unit dropped the matter .\n",
       "[1233] When additional pieces of the puzzle arrived in the spring and summer of 2001 , they\n",
       "[1234] were not put together .\n",
       "[1235] The first piece of the puzzle concerned some intriguing information associated with a\n",
       "[1236] person known as `` Mukhtar '' that the CIA had begun analyzing in April 2001 .\n",
       "[1237] The CIA\n",
       "[1238] did not know who Mukhtar was at the time-only that he associated with al Qaeda\n",
       "[1239] lieutenant Abu Zubaydah and that , based on the nature of the information , he was\n",
       "[1240] evidently involved in planning possible terrorist activities .\n",
       "[1241] The second piece of the puzzle was some alarming information regarding KSM .\n",
       "[1242] On June\n",
       "[1243] 12, 2001 , a CIA report said that `` Khaled '' was actively recruiting people to travel\n",
       "[1244] outside Afghanistan , including to the United States where colleagues were reportedly\n",
       "[1245] already in the country to meet them , to carry out terrorist-related activities for\n",
       "[1246] Bin Ladin .\n",
       "[1247] CIA headquarters presumed from the details of the reporting that this\n",
       "[1248] person was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .\n",
       "[1249] In July , the same source was shown a series of\n",
       "[1250] photographs and identified a photograph of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as the Khaled he\n",
       "[1251] had previously discussed .\n",
       "[1252] The final piece of the puzzle arrived at the CIA 's Bin Ladin unit on August 28 in a\n",
       "[1253] cable reporting that KSM 's nickname was Mukhtar .\n",
       "[1254] No one made the connection to the\n",
       "[1255] reports about Mukhtar that had been circulated in the spring .\n",
       "[1256] This connection might\n",
       "[1257] also have underscored concern about the June reporting that KSM was recruiting\n",
       "[1258] terrorists to travel , including to the United States .\n",
       "[1259] Only after 9/11 would it be\n",
       "[1260] discovered that Muhktar/KSM had communicated with a phone that was used by\n",
       "[1261] Binalshibh , and that Binalshibh had used the same phone to communicate with\n",
