      "A long-distance passive construction is a type of sentence structure in linguistics that involves a combination of passive voice and relativization. In a long-distance passive construction, the subject of the sentence is not the performer of the action described by the verb, but rather an NP (Noun Phrase) that is embedded within a relative clause or a complement clause.\n",
      "\n",
      "The characteristic features of a long-distance passive construction are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Passive voice**: The main clause has a passive verb form, where the subject is not the doer of the action.\n",
      "2. **Relativization**: A relative pronoun (e.g., \"who\", \"which\", etc.) introduces a subordinate clause that provides additional information about the subject or another NP in the sentence.\n",
      "3. **Long-distance**: The relative clause can be separated from the main clause by several layers of embedding, which means that the relationship between the subject and the action described by the verb is not immediately apparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of a long-distance passive construction:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The book that was written by the famous author has been translated into many languages.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In this sentence:\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"The book\" is the subject, but it's not the doer of the action (writing).\n",
      "* The main clause is in the passive voice (\"was written\").\n",
      "* The relative clause \"that was written by the famous author\" provides additional information about the book.\n",
      "* The relationship between the book and the act of writing is not immediately apparent; it takes several layers of embedding to see that the book is the one being written about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long-distance passive constructions can be found in many languages, including English, French, German, Italian, and others. They are often used to express complex relationships between entities or events, and they can add complexity, nuance, and interest to sentence structures.\n"
