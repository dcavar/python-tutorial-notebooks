      "In linguistics, a long-distance passive construction is a type of sentence that involves the movement of an object from a distant clause or phrase to a position after the verb in the main clause. This construction is also known as \"long-distance extraction\" or \"cross- clause extraction\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A clause contains an object (e.g., \"the book\") and a passive verb (e.g., \"is given\").\n",
      "2. The object is moved from its original position to a position after the main verb in the main clause.\n",
      "3. The resulting sentence has the characteristic word order of a passive construction, but with the object moved long-distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "Original sentence: \"The teacher gave the book to John and then it was given away by Mary.\"\n",
      "Long-distance passive construction: \"The book was given away by Mary after being given to John.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, the object \"the book\" is moved from its original position in the subordinate clause (\"to John\") to a position after the main verb \"was given\" in the main clause.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long-distance passive constructions can be found in many languages, including English. They are used to convey complex information and relationships between clauses, making them an important aspect of language structure and syntax.\n"
