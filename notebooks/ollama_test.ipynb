      "In linguistics, a long-distance passive construction (LDPC) refers to a type of sentence where the subject of the sentence is not the one performing the action described by the verb, but rather some other entity that is connected to the main subject through a series of prepositional phrases or other grammatical structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "To illustrate this, consider the following examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The package was sent to Mary by John from Chicago to San Francisco. (Here, \"the package\" is the subject, but it's not performing the action; instead, \"John\" is the agent performing the action of sending.)\n",
      "2. The book was written about ancient civilizations by a team of experts led by Dr. Smith.\n",
      "3. The new policy will be implemented nationwide by the Department of Education.\n",
      "\n",
      "In each case, we have a long-distance passive construction because there are several prepositional phrases or other connectors between the subject (the package, the book, the new policy) and the actual agent performing the action (John, the team of experts led by Dr. Smith, the Department of Education).\n",
      "\n",
      "The key characteristics of LDPCs are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The main subject is not the one performing the action.\n",
      "2. There are several prepositional phrases or other connectors between the subject and the agent.\n",
      "3. The sentence structure is often complex, with multiple clauses or embedded sentences.\n",
      "\n",
      "LDPCs can be found in many languages, including English, Spanish, French, Chinese, Japanese, and others. They can add complexity and nuance to a sentence, allowing speakers to convey more information about the relationships between entities involved in an action.\n"
