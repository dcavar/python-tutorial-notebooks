Dynamic causal discovery in Alzheimer's disease through latent pseudotime modelling

Summary: The application of causal discovery to diseases like Alzheimer's (AD) is
limited by the static graph assumptions of most methods; such models cannot
account for an evolving pathophysiology, modulated by a latent disease
pseudotime. We propose to apply an existing latent variable model to real-world
AD data, inferring a pseudotime that orders patients along a data-driven
disease trajectory independent of chronological age, then learning how causal
relationships evolve. Pseudotime outperformed age in predicting diagnosis (AUC
0.82 vs 0.59). Incorporating minimal, disease-agnostic background knowledge
substantially improved graph accuracy and orientation. Our framework reveals
dynamic interactions between novel (NfL, GFAP) and established AD markers,
enabling practical causal discovery despite violated assumptions.
