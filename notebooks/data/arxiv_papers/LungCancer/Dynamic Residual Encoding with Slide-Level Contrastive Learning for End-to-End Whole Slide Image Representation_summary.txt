Summary: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping,
cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI
representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel
slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to
compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual
encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI
representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of
tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually
contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is
randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then,
additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank.
The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual
encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those
retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is
computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs
within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer
recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the
proposed DRE-SLCL method.
